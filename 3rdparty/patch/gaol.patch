-Requirements
-============
-In order to compile gaol, you will need the following libraries installed:
-
-* cppunit 
-  (http://apps.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/cppunit/index.php?title=Main_Page)
-  This one is only necessary to check the library. 
-  You cannot do "make check" without it

 Basic Installation
 ==================
 
-   These are generic installation instructions.
+   Briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should
+configure, build, and install this package.  The following
+more-detailed instructions are generic; see the `README' file for
+instructions specific to this package.  Some packages provide this
+`INSTALL' file but do not implement all of the features documented
+below.  The lack of an optional feature in a given package is not
+necessarily a bug.  More recommendations for GNU packages can be found
+in *note Makefile Conventions: (standards)Makefile Conventions.
 
    The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
 various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
 those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
 It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
 definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
-you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
-`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
-reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
-(useful mainly for debugging `configure').
+you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, and a
+file `config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for

+
+   It can also use an optional file (typically called `config.cache'
+and enabled with `--cache-file=config.cache' or simply `-C') that saves
+the results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring.  Caching is
+disabled by default to prevent problems with accidental use of stale
+cache files.
 
    If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
 to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
 diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
-be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
-contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.
-
-   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
-called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
-it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

-     `configure' itself.
+     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.

-     messages telling which features it is checking for.

   2. Type `make' to compile the package.
 
-  3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
-     documentation.
+  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
+     the package, generally using the just-built uninstalled binaries.
 
-  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
-     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  
+  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
+     documentation.  When installing into a prefix owned by root, it is
+     recommended that the package be configured and built as a regular
+     user, and only the `make install' phase executed with root
+     privileges.
+
+  5. Optionally, type `make installcheck' to repeat any self-tests, but
+     this time using the binaries in their final installed location.
+     This target does not install anything.  Running this target as a
+     regular user, particularly if the prior `make install' required
+     root privileges, verifies that the installation completed
+     correctly.
+
+  6. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
+     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
+     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
+     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
+     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
+     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
+     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
+     with the distribution.
+
+  7. Often, you can also type `make uninstall' to remove the installed
+     files again.  In practice, not all packages have tested that
+     uninstallation works correctly, even though it is required by the
+     GNU Coding Standards.
+
+  8. Some packages, particularly those that use Automake, provide `make
+     distcheck', which can by used by developers to test that all other
+     targets like `make install' and `make uninstall' work correctly.
+     This target is generally not run by end users.
 
 Compilers and Options
 =====================
 
    Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
-the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
-initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
-a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
-this:
-     CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure
+the `configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help'
+for details on some of the pertinent environment variables.
+
+   You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters
+by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
+is an example:
+
+     ./configure CC=c99 CFLAGS=-g LIBS=-lposix
 
-Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
-     env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure
+   *Note Defining Variables::, for more details.
 
 Compiling For Multiple Architectures
 ====================================
 
    You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
 same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
-own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
-supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
+own directory.  To do this, you can use GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
 directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
 the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
-source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.
+source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.  This
+is known as a "VPATH" build.
 
-   If you have to use a `make' that does not supports the `VPATH'
-variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a time
-in the source code directory.  After you have installed the package for
-one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring for another
-architecture.
+   With a non-GNU `make', it is safer to compile the package for one
+architecture at a time in the source code directory.  After you have
+installed the package for one architecture, use `make distclean' before
+reconfiguring for another architecture.
+
+   On MacOS X 10.5 and later systems, you can create libraries and
+executables that work on multiple system types--known as "fat" or
+"universal" binaries--by specifying multiple `-arch' options to the
+compiler but only a single `-arch' option to the preprocessor.  Like
+this:
+
+     ./configure CC="gcc -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64" \
+                 CXX="g++ -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64" \
+                 CPP="gcc -E" CXXCPP="g++ -E"
+
+   This is not guaranteed to produce working output in all cases, you
+may have to build one architecture at a time and combine the results
+using the `lipo' tool if you have problems.
 
 Installation Names
 ==================
 
-   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
-`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
-installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
-option `--prefix=PATH'.
+   By default, `make install' installs the package's commands under
+`/usr/local/bin', include files under `/usr/local/include', etc.  You
+can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving
+`configure' the option `--prefix=PREFIX', where PREFIX must be an
+absolute file name.
 
    You can specify separate installation prefixes for
 architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
-give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
-PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
-Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.
+pass the option `--exec-prefix=PREFIX' to `configure', the package uses
+PREFIX as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
+Documentation and other data files still use the regular prefix.
+
+   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
+options like `--bindir=DIR' to specify different values for particular
+kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
+you can set and what kinds of files go in them.  In general, the
+default for these options is expressed in terms of `${prefix}', so that
+specifying just `--prefix' will affect all of the other directory
+specifications that were not explicitly provided.
+
+   The most portable way to affect installation locations is to pass the
+correct locations to `configure'; however, many packages provide one or
+both of the following shortcuts of passing variable assignments to the
+`make install' command line to change installation locations without
+having to reconfigure or recompile.
+
+   The first method involves providing an override variable for each
+affected directory.  For example, `make install
+prefix=/alternate/directory' will choose an alternate location for all
+directory configuration variables that were expressed in terms of
+`${prefix}'.  Any directories that were specified during `configure',
+but not in terms of `${prefix}', must each be overridden at install
+time for the entire installation to be relocated.  The approach of
+makefile variable overrides for each directory variable is required by
+the GNU Coding Standards, and ideally causes no recompilation.
+However, some platforms have known limitations with the semantics of
+shared libraries that end up requiring recompilation when using this
+method, particularly noticeable in packages that use GNU Libtool.
+
+   The second method involves providing the `DESTDIR' variable.  For
+example, `make install DESTDIR=/alternate/directory' will prepend
+`/alternate/directory' before all installation names.  The approach of
+`DESTDIR' overrides is not required by the GNU Coding Standards, and
+does not work on platforms that have drive letters.  On the other hand,
+it does better at avoiding recompilation issues, and works well even
+when some directory options were not specified in terms of `${prefix}'
+at `configure' time.
+
+Optional Features
+=================
 
    If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
 with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
 option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.
 
-Optional Features

 you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
 `--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.
 
+   Some packages offer the ability to configure how verbose the
+execution of `make' will be.  For these packages, running `./configure
+--enable-silent-rules' sets the default to minimal output, which can be
+overridden with `make V=1'; while running `./configure
+--disable-silent-rules' sets the default to verbose, which can be
+overridden with `make V=0'.
+
+Particular systems
+==================
+
+   On HP-UX, the default C compiler is not ANSI C compatible.  If GNU
+CC is not installed, it is recommended to use the following options in
+order to use an ANSI C compiler:
+
+     ./configure CC="cc -Ae -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=500"
+
+and if that doesn't work, install pre-built binaries of GCC for HP-UX.
+
+   On OSF/1 a.k.a. Tru64, some versions of the default C compiler cannot
+parse its `<wchar.h>' header file.  The option `-nodtk' can be used as
+a workaround.  If GNU CC is not installed, it is therefore recommended
+to try
+
+     ./configure CC="cc"
+
+and if that doesn't work, try
+
+     ./configure CC="cc -nodtk"
+
+   On Solaris, don't put `/usr/ucb' early in your `PATH'.  This
+directory contains several dysfunctional programs; working variants of
+these programs are available in `/usr/bin'.  So, if you need `/usr/ucb'
+in your `PATH', put it _after_ `/usr/bin'.
+
+   On Haiku, software installed for all users goes in `/boot/common',
+not `/usr/local'.  It is recommended to use the following options:
+
+     ./configure --prefix=/boot/common
+
 Specifying the System Type
 ==========================
 
-   There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
-automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host the package
-will run on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints

+Defining Variables
 ==================

-VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
-
-Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
-
-Configuration:
-  -h, --help              display this help and exit
-      --help=short        display options specific to this package
-      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
-  -V, --version           display version information and exit
-  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking...' messages
-      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
-  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
-  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
-      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']

-Installation directories:
-  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
-			  [$ac_default_prefix]
-  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
-			  [PREFIX]
-
-By default, \`make install' will install all the files in

-an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
-for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.
-

-  CPP         C preprocessor
-  YACC        The `Yet Another C Compiler' implementation to use. Defaults to
-              the first program found out of: `bison -y', `byacc', `yacc'.
-  YFLAGS      The list of arguments that will be passed by default to $YACC.
-              This script will default YFLAGS to the empty string to avoid a
-              default value of `-d' given by some make applications.
-  CXX         C++ compiler command
-  CXXFLAGS    C++ compiler flags
-  CXXCPP      C++ preprocessor
-
-Use these variables to override the choices made by `configure' or to help
-it to find libraries and programs with nonstandard names/locations.

-\`configure' configures gaol "4.2.0" to adapt to many kinds of systems.
-
-Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
-
-To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
-VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
-
-Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
-
-Configuration:
-  -h, --help              display this help and exit
-      --help=short        display options specific to this package
-      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
-  -V, --version           display version information and exit
-  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking...' messages
-      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
-  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
-  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
-      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']
-
-Installation directories:
-  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
-			  [$ac_default_prefix]
-  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
-			  [PREFIX]
-
-By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
-\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
-an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
-for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.
-
-For better control, use the options below.
-
-Fine tuning of the installation directories:
-  --bindir=DIR           user executables [EPREFIX/bin]

-  YFLAGS      The list of arguments that will be passed by default to $YACC.
-              This script will default YFLAGS to the empty string to avoid a
-              default value of `-d' given by some make applications.
-  CC          C compiler command
-  CFLAGS      C compiler flags
-  LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
-              nonstandard directory <lib dir>
-  LIBS        libraries to pass to the linker, e.g. -l<library>
-  CPPFLAGS    C/C++/Objective C preprocessor flags, e.g. -I<include dir> if
-              you have headers in a nonstandard directory <include dir>
-  CXX         C++ compiler command
-  CXXFLAGS    C++ compiler flags
-  CPP         C preprocessor
-  CXXCPP      C++ preprocessor
-
-Use these variables to override the choices made by `configure' or to help
-it to find libraries and programs with nonstandard names/locations.

-\`configure' configures gaol "4.2.0" to adapt to many kinds of systems.
-
-Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
-
-To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
-VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
-
-Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
-
-Configuration:
-  -h, --help              display this help and exit
-      --help=short        display options specific to this package
-      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
-  -V, --version           display version information and exit
-  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking...' messages
-      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
-  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
-  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
-      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']
-
-Installation directories:
-  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
-			  [$ac_default_prefix]
-  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
-			  [PREFIX]
-
-By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
-\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
-an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
-for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.
-
-For better control, use the options below.
-
-Fine tuning of the installation directories:
-  --bindir=DIR           user executables [EPREFIX/bin]
-  --sbindir=DIR          system admin executables [EPREFIX/sbin]

-  --localstatedir=DIR    modifiable single-machine data [PREFIX/var]
-  --libdir=DIR           object code libraries [EPREFIX/lib]
-  --includedir=DIR       C header files [PREFIX/include]
-  --oldincludedir=DIR    C header files for non-gcc [/usr/include]
-  --datarootdir=DIR      read-only arch.-independent data root [PREFIX/share]
-  --datadir=DIR          read-only architecture-independent data [DATAROOTDIR]
-  --infodir=DIR          info documentation [DATAROOTDIR/info]

-
-Some influential environment variables:
-  CC          C compiler command
-  CFLAGS      C compiler flags

-  CPP         C preprocessor
-  YACC        The `Yet Another C Compiler' implementation to use. Defaults to
-              the first program found out of: `bison -y', `byacc', `yacc'.
-  YFLAGS      The list of arguments that will be passed by default to $YACC.
-              This script will default YFLAGS to the empty string to avoid a
-              default value of `-d' given by some make applications.
-  CXX         C++ compiler command
-  CXXFLAGS    C++ compiler flags
-  CXXCPP      C++ preprocessor
-
-Use these variables to override the choices made by `configure' or to help
-it to find libraries and programs with nonstandard names/locations.
-
-Report bugs to <goualard@users.sourceforge.net>.
